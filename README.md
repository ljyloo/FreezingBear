![image](https://github.com/FreezingBear/FreezingBear/blob/master/src/main/resources/Version.jpg)
A plugin supports Minecraft:Pocket Edition join CraftBukkit Server. In fact, it supports different MCPE versions!

A big change upcoming in MCPE 0.12.x, so the development progress might slow down. :)

Compatible with:
* Bukkit/Spigot 1.8
* Minecraft 1.8
* Minecraft: Pocket Edition 0.12.x

## Can it fully work now?
Nope, the plugin is still in early development.

## How does it work?
Basicly, it's just like a translator. It translate from both PC and PE, and send the action to the target.

## What about things does not exist?
Most of the blocks, items doesn't exist in PE, so FreezingBear just ignore them. In the future, it will allow user to custom the block and item to replace.

## Does it support Bukkit plugins?
Mostly. FreezingBear gives PE player separate Player class and Entity class, same to CraftPlayer and EntityPlayer class.

## Can I contribe?
Ofcourse, the project will be much better with your help! Check out the latest develop version.
